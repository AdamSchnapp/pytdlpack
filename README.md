# pytdlpack

## Introduction

NOAA/NWS Meteorological Development Lab (MDL) produces model output statistics (MOS) for a variety of NOAA/NCEP Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.  MOS is produced via MDL's in-house MOS-2000 (MOS2K) software system.  The MOS2K software system uses a GRIB-like binary data format called TDLPACK.  `pytdlpack` is a Python interface to reading and writing TDLPACK files.
